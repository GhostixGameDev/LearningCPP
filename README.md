  My C++ learning courve.
</H1>

Hi, in this repository, me and my friend FrabSito share our footsteps learning C++. This is our first time using this language and using a low level language.

<h2>Our learning courve atm</h2>
<h3>First day:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Hello World</li>
  <li>How do we use pointers/nullptr and what tf are they?</li>
  <li>Lets make a ASCII TicTacToe game! How hard can it be? Come on, we both are beasts on JAVA...</li>
  <li>tf is a .h?</li>
  <li>Why are our interfaces and implementations not working? *3 Hours Later* So... Our code was already working from the start we just had to list all our cpp files on the g++ command...</li>
  <li>YIPPIEEEEE, our TicTacToe is working!</li>
</ol>

Yes. We went from Hello World to making a game.
